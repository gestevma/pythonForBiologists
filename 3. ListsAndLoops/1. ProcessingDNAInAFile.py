# The file input.txt contains a number of DNA sequences, one per line. Each sequence
# starts with the same 14 base pair fragment â€“ a sequencing adapter that should have
# been removed. Write a program that will (a) trim this adapter and write the cleaned
# sequences to a new file and (b) print the length of each sequence to the screen.

#Open the input file and the file where write the cleaned sequence
